Sequencing animation Notes

  In this section I will learn how to update a page to play a series of animations in a sequence using promise-based APIs

  The instructions for this assignment asked to update the images on the page in three different methods. 
    1. First method is the finished then callback hell
    2. Second method used to animate all the images was the promise chain method
    3. The third and final method is the async and await.
