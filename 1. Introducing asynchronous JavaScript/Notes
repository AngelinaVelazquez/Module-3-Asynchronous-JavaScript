Asynchronous programming
  - Is used to have other task run and get work done without having to wait for web browsers for example when using APIs
  - running long synchronous functions takes a long time
  - also programs can be unresponsive and do not let the user do any other task without finishing the function that is running. 
  - it should let users know that an operation has been completed

Event handlers are a form of asynchronous programming
  - a function will be called eventually
  - if the event does take place the caller is notified of the result

Early APIs used event handlers example: XMLHttpRequest API

Callbacks are an event handler. its a function passed into another function. Here the callback is called at a set time. 

Callbacks pass in functions to another functions. 
  "the parent function executes the function that we pass in" Zach Gollwitzer

nest callbacks make it hard to handle errors. 

Modern APIs do not use callbacks instead they use promises.
